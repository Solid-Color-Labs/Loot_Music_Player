/* This application was designed using the Model-View-ViewModel design pattern.
 * To make it easy for me to use this pattern, I'm using MVVM light (http://www.mvvmlight.net),
 * which is a library/framework, that helps facilitate the use of the MVVM pattern.
 * 
 * The UI was created using MahApps metro (https://github.com/MahApps/MahApps.Metro). All mahapps metro 
 * apps use the MetroWindow. Mahapps metro makes it possible to build a modern looking WPF application
 *  from the start.-->
